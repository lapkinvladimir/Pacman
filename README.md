# Pacman
The "Pacman on Java" project is an implementation of the classic arcade game "Pacman" using the Java programming language. The game features a maze where the player controls the Pacman character to collect all the dots while avoiding collisions with ghosts. The goal of the game is to score the highest points by collecting all the dots.

Key features of the project include:

A graphical user interface that displays the maze and characters.
Keyboard-based control of the Pacman character.
Implementation of artificial intelligence for the ghosts, which try to "catch" the Pacman.
Scoring system and display of the current score.
Collision detection between Pacman and ghosts, as well as between Pacman and dots in the maze.
Different difficulty levels with various mazes and ghost placements.
The "Pacman on Java" project provides developers an opportunity to learn and practice game development using Java, and allows fans of the "Pacman" game to enjoy the classic gameplay of this popular arcade game.
